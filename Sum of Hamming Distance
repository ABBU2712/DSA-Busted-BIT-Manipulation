#Hamming distance between two non-negative integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

#Given an array A of N non-negative integers, find the sum of hamming distances of all pairs of integers in the array. Return the answer modulo 1000000007.

class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def hammingDistance(self, A):
        ans = 0  # Initialize result
        n=len(A)
 
    # traverse over all bits
        for i in range(0, 32):
            count = 0
            for j in range(0, n):
                if ( (A[j] & (1 << i)) ):
                    count+= 1
 
        # Add "count * (n - count) * 2" to the answer
            ans += (count * (n - count) * 2) ##This is an permutation
     
        return ans
